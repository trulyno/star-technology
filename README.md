Star Technology is one of the first **GregTech CEu Modern** modpacks for **Minecraft 1.19.2**, now fully updated to **1.20.1**! While still under development, the pack is fully playable **up to Ancient Stargate(_end of UHV, start of UEV_)**, with **Post-UHV content actively being worked on!**

This is **not** a beginner-friendly modpack, but we are constantly improving accessibility to make it more approachable for new players.
